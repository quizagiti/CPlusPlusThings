If you are looking for a software that can create stunning photo engravings on your CNC machine, you might want to try PhotoVCarve. PhotoVCarve is a software developed by Vectric that allows you to convert any image into a 3D carving or a lithophane. You can also use it to create V-groove engravings that vary in width and depth according to the image details.
 
But how can you get PhotoVCarve for free? Well, the good news is that Vectric offers a free trial version of PhotoVCarve that you can download and use without any time limit or personal details required. The free trial version has all the features enabled and comes with some free projects that you can download and cut on your CNC machine.

To download the free trial version of PhotoVCarve, you need to visit the Vectric website[^1^] and click on the "Download Free Trial" button. You will be asked to enter your email address and choose your operating system. Then, you will receive a link to download the software installer. Once you have downloaded and installed the software, you can launch it and start using it.
 
To use PhotoVCarve, you need to open an image file that you want to engrave. You can use any image format, such as JPG, PNG, BMP, or GIF. You can also adjust the image size, orientation, contrast, brightness, and gamma. Then, you need to choose a toolpath strategy from the options available: 3D grayscale machining, 3D lithophane machining, or V-groove machining. Each strategy has its own parameters that you can customize according to your preferences and machine capabilities.
 
After choosing a toolpath strategy, you need to select a tool from the tool database or create your own custom tool. You can also specify the material settings, such as thickness, clearance, feed rate, plunge rate, spindle speed, etc. Then, you can preview the toolpath and see how it will look on your material. You can also simulate the cutting time and estimate the material cost.
 
When you are satisfied with the toolpath preview, you can save it as a G-code file that you can send to your CNC machine. You can also export it as an STL file if you want to use it with another software or 3D printer.
 
As you can see, PhotoVCarve is a powerful and easy-to-use software that can help you create amazing photo engravings on your CNC machine. However, there is one limitation of the free trial version: it does not allow you to save or output files larger than 500 x 500 pixels. If you want to remove this limitation and access more features and support from Vectric, you need to buy the full version of PhotoVCarve for $149 / Â£110 / â¬135 (excludes local taxes).
 
You can buy PhotoVCarve from the Vectric website[^1^] or from one of their authorized resellers. You will receive a license code that you can use to activate the full version of the software on up to three computers. You will also get access to over 90 hours of video tutorials and a thriving forum with over 20,000 active members who can help you with any questions or issues.
