For instance, when Kanji is asked to prove that God exists in court, he says that he cannot prove it, but neither can anyone else. He also questions why people need to pay money to worship God, when God is supposed to be everywhere and free. He argues that God does not need temples, idols, rituals or intermediaries, but only a direct connection with the devotees. He challenges the self-proclaimed godmen and religious leaders who exploit people's fears and emotions for their own benefit. He exposes their frauds and tricks and reveals their true motives.
