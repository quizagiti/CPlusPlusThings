NieR:Automata is a post-apocalyptic action RPG developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to the 2010 game NieR, which itself is a spin-off of the Drakengard series. NieR:Automata follows the story of androids 2B, 9S and A2 as they fight to reclaim a machine-dominated world for their human creators.
 
The Day One Edition of NieR:Automata includes some bonus content, such as a reversible box art, a pod skin and some wallpapers. However, the game also has a DRM protection called Denuvo, which prevents users from playing the game without an internet connection or modifying the game files.

BALDMAN is a notorious hacker who has cracked many Denuvo-protected games, such as Prey, Dishonored 2 and Resident Evil 7. He has released a crack for NieR:Automata that bypasses the Denuvo protection and allows users to play the game offline and with mods. The crack also fixes some performance issues that plague the original game, such as stuttering and crashes.
 
The crack is available for download from various sources, such as cs.rin.ru or torrent sites. However, users should be careful of fake or malicious files that may harm their computers or steal their personal information. Users should also support the developers by buying the game if they enjoy it.

To install the crack, users need to download the NieR:Automata-Day.One.Edition.v1787043.Crack.V3.by.BALDMAN.rar file and extract it to a folder. Then, they need to copy the nierautomata.exe crack file from the BALDMAN V3 archive and paste it into the installation directory of the game, overwriting the original file. Finally, they need to run SSELauncher.exe as Administrator and create a desktop shortcut for NieRAutomata in SSELauncher.

There are many mods for NieR:Automata that enhance the game experience or add new features. Some of the most popular mods are FAR (Fix Automata Resolution), which improves the game's resolution and graphics settings; NAIOM (NieR Automata Input Overhaul Mod), which adds keyboard and mouse support and remapping options; and HD Texture Pack, which replaces the low-quality textures with high-resolution ones.
 
NieR:Automata does not have a direct sequel yet, but it has a prequel called NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139..., which is a remaster of the original NieR game with improved graphics, gameplay and voice acting. It was released in April 2021 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. It tells the story of a young man who journeys with a talking book named Grimoire Weiss to find a cure for his sister's deadly disease.

NieR:Automata is widely praised for its story, characters, gameplay, music and themes. It has won many awards and accolades, such as the Game Developers Choice Awards for Best Design and Best Narrative, the Japan Game Awards for Excellence and the British Academy Games Awards for Music. It has also sold over six million copies worldwide as of June 2021.
 
However, NieR:Automata also has some flaws and controversies. Some critics have pointed out the game's technical issues, such as bugs, glitches and poor optimization. Some fans have also expressed dissatisfaction with the game's DLC, which they felt was overpriced and lacked meaningful content. Moreover, some people have accused the game of being sexist or fetishizing its female characters, especially 2B, who wears a revealing outfit and has a large fanbase.
 
Despite these criticisms, NieR:Automata remains a cult classic and a masterpiece of video game storytelling. It explores complex and philosophical topics, such as the meaning of life, the nature of humanity, the consequences of war and the power of choice. It also offers multiple endings and perspectives that challenge the player's expectations and emotions. It is a game that deserves to be experienced by anyone who loves video games.
