This product includes the sheet music for the trombone and piano parts, as well as a CD with the orchestral accompaniment. The concerto was written by Launy Grondahl, a Danish composer and conductor who was influenced by the Nordic folk music and the French impressionism. He composed this piece in 1924 while he was staying in Italy, and it is one of his most popular works. It has three movements: Allegro moderato ma energico, Quasi una leggenda, and Finale (Rondo). The trombone part is challenging and expressive, requiring a wide range of dynamics and techniques. The concerto is considered a staple of the trombone repertoire and has been performed by many famous trombonists. If you are interested in other works by Grondahl or other composers for string quartet, you might also like Alcalay: L'intereur des pensÃ©es - Full score and parts (String Quartet), which is a contemporary piece that explores the inner thoughts and emotions of the four musicians.
