## What is a Key Management Service (KMS)?
 
A Key Management Service (KMS) is a server that hosts a KMS key and can activate a specific number of Office clients within a network. The KMS key is a special type of product key that can activate multiple computers at once. The KMS key must be installed on the KMS host computer, which can be any computer running Windows Server or Windows client operating system. The KMS host computer must also have the Microsoft Office 2013 Volume License Pack installed, which contains the KMS activation service and the required licenses for Office products.
 
To activate Office 2013 clients using KMS, you need to do the following steps:

1. Install the KMS key on the KMS host computer by using the slmgr.vbs script or the VAMT.
2. Configure the KMS host name and port on the Office clients by using the ospp.vbs script or the VAMT.
3. Activate the Office clients by using the ospp.vbs script or the VAMT.

## What is Active Directory-Based activation?
 
Active Directory-Based activation is a method that uses Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to store and distribute activation information for Office clients. This method does not require a dedicated activation server, but it requires that all Office clients are joined to an AD DS domain and that the domain controllers have Windows Server 2012 or later installed. The domain controllers must also have the Volume Activation Services role installed, which enables them to store and publish activation objects in AD DS.
 
To activate Office 2013 clients using Active Directory-Based activation, you need to do the following steps:

1. Add the volume license key to AD DS by using the Volume Activation Tools wizard on a domain controller.
2. Configure the Office clients to use Active Directory-Based activation by using Group Policy or the ospp.vbs script.
3. Activate the Office clients by using the ospp.vbs script or Group Policy.

## How to use ospp.vbs to activate Office 2013 clients?
 
The ospp.vbs script is a command-line tool that enables you to configure and activate volume licensed versions of Office products, including Project and Visio. The ospp.vbs script is located in the Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office16 folder. If you installed the 32-bit version of Office on a 64-bit operating system, go to the Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Office16 folder. Running ospp.vbs requires the cscript.exe script engine.
