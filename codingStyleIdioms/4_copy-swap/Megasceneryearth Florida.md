But Florida is not just about scenery. It's also a great place to fly over some of the busiest and most challenging airports in the world. Whether you want to test your skills with a tricky landing, or just enjoy the sight of planes taking off and landing, you will find plenty of options in Florida.
 
One of the most popular airports in Florida is Miami International Airport (MIA)[^2^], which is the primary airport serving the Miami area. It's a hub for American Airlines and American Eagle, as well as a focus airport for Avianca, LAN Airlines and TAM Brazilian Airlines. It has passenger and cargo flights to cities throughout the Americas, Europe and Western Asia. It's also one of only seven U.S. airports to accommodate the Airbus A380 jumbo jet. Flying into or out of MIA will give you a spectacular view of the city skyline, the beaches and the port.
 
Another airport that will challenge your piloting skills is Sebring Regional Airport (SEF)[^3^], which is located in Sebring, Florida. This airport is home to the U.S. Sport Aviation Expo, an annual event that showcases light sport aircraft and ultralights. It also hosts the 12 Hours of Sebring, an endurance race for sports cars. The airport has two runways, one of which is 5,224 feet long and the other is 3,940 feet long. The shorter runway is used for gliders and ultralights, while the longer one is used for general aviation and commercial flights.
