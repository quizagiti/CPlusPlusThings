Animal Kingdom is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you question your morals and sympathies. It is a film that shows the dark and dangerous side of human nature and the consequences of living in a lawless society. It is a film that deserves to be seen by anyone who enjoys a well-crafted and powerful crime drama.
  
The film begins with J watching a game show on television with his mother, who is lying on the couch next to him. He calls an ambulance when he realizes that she is dead from a heroin overdose. He then contacts his estranged grandmother, Smurf, who takes him in and introduces him to his uncles: Pope, the oldest and most unstable; Craig, a drug dealer and user; and Darren, the youngest and most naive. J also meets Pope's best friend and partner in crime, Barry "Baz" Brown, who is trying to convince Pope to quit their life of crime and invest their money in the stock market.
 
However, their plans are interrupted when two armed robbers, working for a rival gang, attack one of Craig's drug labs and kill two of his associates. Pope and Baz decide to retaliate by killing two policemen who were staking out their house. This sparks a war between the Cody family and the Armed Robbery Squad of the Victoria Police, led by Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie. Leckie tries to persuade J to cooperate with the police and testify against his uncles, offering him protection and immunity. J is torn between his loyalty to his family and his fear of their violence.
 
As the police pressure intensifies, the Cody family begins to unravel from within. Pope becomes increasingly paranoid and erratic, suspecting that Baz is planning to betray him and join forces with the police. He hires a hitman to kill Baz in his car, leaving J as the only witness. J is shocked and traumatized by Baz's death, but Smurf convinces him to keep quiet and not implicate Pope. She also arranges for J to date a friend's daughter, Nicky Henry, in order to distract him from his grief and guilt.
